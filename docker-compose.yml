  # The Poe-it application container. We have two of those containers listed here, one version that depends on the
  # cloudsql container and a version that depends on the localsql container. Unfortunately we can't merge those, since
  # the depends_on parameter requires that all listed container will actually start. But since the 'local' and 'cloud'
  # profile are mutually exclusive, only one dependency will start.
  # To prevent that we have to write the same parameters another time, we will save the following into an anchor and
  # reload them with an alias in the other profile. We will then overwrite attributes that should differ.
